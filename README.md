# denver-date-night-generator
Ever want to go on a date night but just can't decide what to do? The Denver Date Night Generator takes this stress away! With ideas specific to the Denver Metro area, this app will tell you an awesome date idea with the click of a button. If you're feeling spontaneous, commit to the first date that pops up! Or if that's not your style, feel free to keep clicking until you find something that suits your fancy. 

##How Denver Date Night Generator Works
Written in Android Studio using Kotlin and XML, the generator pulls a new random date night from a list of predefined options and prints it to the screen each time the button is clicked in the UI. 

##How to use Denver Date Night Generator
My goal is to continue adding features to the application and eventually release it in the Google Play store. For now though, you will have to run the application in Android Studio on an emulator. 
1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6s2IBhCnARIsAP8RfAiUSYFnFdNOv_dxxRBFAW_X8WI5yhXETd1uUyslmUwdCNfgkMQxfSoaAk7-EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
2. Download DenverDateNightGenerator.zip
3. Ensure the appropriate versions and gradle are installed
4. Click **Open** to access an existing project and select the DenverDateNightGenerator folder 
5. Select your emulator (I used the Pixel 4) and click run!
